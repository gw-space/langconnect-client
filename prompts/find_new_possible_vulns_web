1. Identify IMSI finding or tracking Mobile Network Vulnerabilities
	•	Use both web search and cve-search_mcp to find vulnerabilities related to mobile communications (e.g., 3G, 4G, 5G).
	•	For each discovered vulnerability, check if a similar one already exists in the Mobile Vulnerabilities collection.

2. If Not Found in Mobile Vulnerabilities Collection:
	•	Create a document using enable_chunking: false with the following structure:
    [metadata fields for Mobile Vulnerabilities]
        "source": "web search" or "cve-search_mcp",
        "cve_id": "CVE-ID if available, else none",
        "cvd_id": "CVD-ID if available, else none",
        "affected_technologies": ["4G", "5G", etc.]
        "severity": 1 to 10

    [content fields for Mobile Vulnerabilities]
        "source": "web page URL or cve-search_mcp",
        "vulnerability name": "...",
        "vulnerability id cve": "",
        "coordinated disclosure_id_cvd": "",
        "related standards": ["3GPP spec IDs (e.g., TS 43.020)"],
        "related publications": ["..."],
        "affected technologies": ["..."]],
        "vendors affected": [],
        "root cause": "...",
        "impact": "...",
        "3GPP spec content related to root cause": "...",
        "summary": "..."    

3. Link to 3GPP Specification
	•	For each vulnerability, find the related 3GPP specification in the 3GPP Specification collection. You can use list_document_groups or list_available_specs.
	•	If not present:
	1.	Use check_3gpp_link to get the download URL.
    	•	3GPP ZIP filenames use a base-36 encoded version code.
        •	Format: <TS number>-<version code>.zip
        Example: 38331-i60.zip
            •	Decode as:
            •	i = 18 (base-36 → Release 18)
            •	6 = 6
            •	0 = 0
        → This means version 18.6.0 (Release 18)
        Only proceed if the decoded major version is 18.
	2.	Download using download_3gpp_document.
    	•	Path: /Users/yungeon-u/Desktop/Project/3gpp-document-downloader-mcp/downloads/
        •	If the specified ZIP file already exists in this directory, skip download.(You can use Filesystem tool)
        •	You may use check_download_status to confirm download completion.
	3.	Upload it to 3GPP Specification collection using upload_local_file
        •	enable_chunking: true, 
        •	chunksize = 4000, overlap= 600.
        •	collection: 3GPP Specification
          [metadata fields for 3GPP Specification]
            "spec_number": "TS 38.331",  // This is Example 
            "spec_title": "NR; Radio Resource Control (RRC) protocol specification",  // Example title
            "release": "Rel-18",// This is Example 
            "organization": "3GPP",// This is Example 
            "technology": "5G",// This is Example 
            "key_content": "5G Radio Access"// This is Example 
        •	If any metadata field is unknown, perform web search to find the accurate value.
        •	Do not modify or perform any other task not explicitly described.

4. This is most important part. Perform new possible idea or vulnerability derivation especially about IMSI finding or tracking from 3gpp specifications using mobile vulnerabilities collection and add the results to the Possible Vulnerability collection.
For each document:
  0. From the phrases in the 3GPP specification collection, use the information from the mobile vulnerabilities collection to identify potential new vulnerabilities in the 3GPP specification documents. Do not include vulnerabilities that already exist. The new vulnerabilities must be completely different from the existing ones. Derive ideas based on entirely new approaches.
	1.	Cross-reference the document with:
	  •	Relevant specifications in the 3GPP Specification collection.
	  •	Related and corroborative information from public internet sources.
	2.	Identify any new possible vulnerabilities that could be inferred or derived based on the information in the 3GPP specifications.
	  •	If no significant or potentially exploitable issue is found in the specifications, skip the document.
	3.	For any newly discovered possible vulnerability:
	  •	Carefully assess and assign an attack feasibility score on a scale from 1 (low feasibility) to 10 (high feasibility).
  	•	Important!: Check for duplicates: Before adding, ensure that the same vulnerability does not already exist in the Possible Vulnerabilities collection (based on similar metadata and content).
	4.	If it is confirmed as new:
	  •	Insert it into the Possible Vulnerabilities collection using the exact JSON format below.
	  •	Set enable_chunking: false.
	  •	All keys in metadata and content must remain unchanged. Do not alter or rename any fields.
	  •	The example values below are for demonstration only. All values must be updated based on actual analysis.

    [metadata fields for Possible Vulnerabilities]
      "source": "gpt-4o",  // ← Use the actual LLM model used (e.g., gpt-4o, claude sonnet 4)
      "severity": "high",
      "spec_reference": "TS 24.008, TS 36.413",  // ← Reference actual relevant 3GPP specs
      "attack_complexity": "high",
      "attack_feasibility": 3,  // ← Integer score from 1 (lowest) to 10 (highest)
      "source_collection": "3GPP_Specification",
      "vulnerability_type": "handover_security",  // ← Use appropriate category
      "affected_generations": "3G, 4G, 5G",  // ← Adjust per analysis
      "verified": false  // ← Always false on initial insertion

Important Notes:
	•	All keys in metadata and content must remain unchanged. Do not alter or rename any fields.
	•	Only insert the document if it is clearly a new vulnerability not already present in the Mobile Vulnerabilities and Possible Vulnerabilities collection.
	•	All values must be accurate and based on technical analysis of 3GPP specifications or other credible sources.
	•	Avoid false positives: skip if the document/spec does not present a meaningful security issue.
